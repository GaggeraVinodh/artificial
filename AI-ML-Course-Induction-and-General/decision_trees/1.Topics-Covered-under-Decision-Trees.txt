

what did we cover so far in decision trees?

ID3 handles both categorical and continuous values in its 
inputs and it is used for classification only

"Change in Variance" method is used for creating regresssion trees

Gini Index is the parameter used in CART algorithm and it is applicable both for categorical and continuous input variables

Then we have the C4.5 which is an improvement algorithm which is applicable for both categorical and continuous input variables
