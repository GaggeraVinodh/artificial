difference between GINI index and information gain

The Gini Index facilitates the bigger distributions so easy to implement whereas the Information Gain favors lesser distributions having small count with multiple specific values

The method of the Gini Index is used by CART algorithms, in contrast to it, Information Gain is used in ID3, C4.5 algorithms

Gini index operates on the categorical target variables in terms of “success” or “failure” and performs only binary split, in opposite to that Information Gain computes the difference between entropy before and after the split and indicates the impurity in classes of elements.
