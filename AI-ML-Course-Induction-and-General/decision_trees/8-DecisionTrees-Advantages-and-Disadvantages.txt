
decision trees advantages

decision trees are easy to understand and have a easier learning curve (easy to understand, but not easy to build, with pun intended)

decision trees require no domain knowledge

The learning and classification steps of a 
decision tree are simple and fast

decision trees automatically do feature selection
and variable screening

algorithms using decision trees are easy to explain 
to top-management

this is not only used in ML, but this is widely used tool to take business decisions by CEOs, board senior management, like growing bottom line or topline, whether to acquire a startup or leave it

if there are non-linear relationships between the features of data, it does not affect the performance of the trees

decision trees do not require special effort from the users in terms of data preparation



decision trees dis-advantages

decision trees tend to be very long

decision trees have much lesser performance metric
compared to naive bayes and SVM

it is not easy to understand how to build the tree
