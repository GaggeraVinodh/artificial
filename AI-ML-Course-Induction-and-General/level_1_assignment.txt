Assignments:  Applied Statistics & NLP spoc:anilkumar.ganesh@wipro.com  TT-Architect Academy (A) 

Applied Statistics:   (Make use of Pandas, Numpy) 

Ex 1. For a given set of values in stats.xls that contains the list of employees, years of experience and their salary write a python script to calculate the mean, mode and median. 

Ex2. For the above exercise determine the standard deviation and variance through python scripting. 

(B)Natural Language Processing: (Make use of Pandas, NLTK)

Ex 1. Write a python script that reads the data_in.csv from every cell in column labeled as comment and perform sentence tokenization and redirects in to column of data_out.csv. Perform the NE Chunking on these sentences. 

Ex 2. Write a python script that reads the data_in.csv from every cell in column labeled as comment and perform word tokenization and redirects in to column of data_out.csv

Ex3. From an input file data.txt it is required to identify the POS-Tagging and display it on tree structure. 

Ex 4. For a given text file exclude the stop words and perform the Stemming & lemmatization and compare the results. 

Ex 5. Create a small dictionary file with required set of words with weightage attached to it with positive and negative numbers. Create a python script that analyzes the given text file and classify it as negative or positive sentiment. 

(C) Machine Learning:  Machine Learning spoc: snehalatha.nagamangala@wipro.com   TT-Architect Academy  Machine Learning Linear regression assignments  

Write a python script  BEST FIT LINE - Calling SKlearn linear regression Ex 1. Data: 1.Download the MPG data file from UCI Machine Learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/2.Identify target variable and independent variable. 3.Prepare the data file Univariate Regression Ex 2. Import relevant python libraries and sklearn linear_model  Ex 3. Split the file into train [80%] and test [20%] data Ex 4. Apply linear regression  Ex 5. Train the model using the training sets  Ex 6. Display the coefficients coef, intercept and residues Ex 7.Predict using test data  Ex 8. Perform Accuracy check using the R Square Ex 9. Display using scatter plot the data points and the best fit line Multi-variate Regression Repeat the above steps  BEST FIT LINE - Cost function using un-constrained method - Gradient descent Ex 1. Use the downloaded data Ex 2. Convert this data to array Ex 3. Define the learning rate and no. of iterations as 0.0001 and 1000 respectively along with y-intercept and slope Ex 4. Create the functions to get the BEST FIT line 

1.Compute error for the line given the points 2.Step gradient function 3.Gradient descent Ex 5. Display using scatter plot the data points and the best fit line Ex 6. Display the Gradient and y-intercept value in the form y = mx+c   Ex 7. Find the BEST FIT line i.e., m and c of y=mx+c with least error using trial and error method i.e., modify learning rate or iterations or both Machine Learning KNN assignments   Ex 1. Data: 1.Download the census data file from UCI Machine Learning repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/haberman/2.Identify target variable and independent variable. 3.Prepare the data file Ex 2. Import relevant python libraries and sklearn KNN model  Ex 3. Split the file into train [80%] and test [20%] data Ex 4.  Apply KNN algorithm Ex 5. Train the model using the training set Ex 6. Predict using test data  Ex 8. Perform Accuracy check   *******
