We are using this to understand naive bayes 
classification algorithm

argmaxc ? candidates P(c|w) 
By Bayes' Theorem this is equivalent to:
argmaxc ? candidates P(c) P(w|c) / P(w)

P(c|w) = P(c) P(w|c) / P(w)

Since P(w) is the same for every possible candidate c, we can factor it out, giving: argmaxc ? candidates P(c) P(w|c)

The four parts of this expression are:
Selection Mechanism: argmax 
We choose the candidate with the highest combined probability.
Candidate Model: c ? candidates
This tells us which candidate corrections, c, to consider

Language Model: P(c) 
The probability that c appears as a word of English text. For example, occurrences of "the" make up about 7% of English text, so we should have P(the) = 0.07

Error Model: P(w|c)
The probability that w would be typed in a text when the author meant c. For example, P(teh|the) is relatively high, but P(theeexyz|the) would be very low.
