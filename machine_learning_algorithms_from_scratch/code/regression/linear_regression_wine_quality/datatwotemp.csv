# The below value is the error that we get for case 1, when load is constant
# The tyre pressure is almost constant at 50psi
# multiple variable regresssion algorithm for doing regression
# case 2 with complete load from start to finish
# this is the csv file input to the model with the tiles
# Initial_SOC,Final_SOC,Charge_utilized,payload,tyre_pressure,range_covered
# as we can see from the data for the same charge we are getting a slightly better range
