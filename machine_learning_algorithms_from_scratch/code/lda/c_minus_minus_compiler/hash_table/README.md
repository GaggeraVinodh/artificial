A basic implementation of a hash table in C.
No resizing yet.
Functions supported:
1. Insert key.
2. Lookup key.
3. Print table.

Compilation instructions:
1. For normal compilation, just run make. An executable hashtable will be 
   created.
2. For compilation with some debug statements, run "make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG". This 
   will print out some debug information (for example the hash values of keys), 
   when the hashtable is executed.
