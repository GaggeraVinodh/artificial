random forests 

increase accuracy
give more stability
it reduces variance becuase
each tree is completey different

hyper parameters

n estmators = number of trees
d depth     = depth of the tree

D data     = amount of data at each node
randomness = you can use, WOR WR or any other type of sampling

M and m = number of features at each tree
splitting criteria = gini index or information gain

number of folds in cross validation - 2 fold or 5 fold
or hold out dataset, LOOCV - Leave One Out Cross Validation

amount of data used for testing - all of oob sample and
the test data
