random forest
-------------

each decision tree in the forest considers a random subset of features when forming questions and only has access to a random set of the training data points. This increases diversity in the forest leading to more robust overall predictions

wisdom of the random and diverse crowd

hyperparameters for tuning random forests

try adjusting the following set of hyperparameters

variable n - number of features

n_estimators = number of trees in the foreset

max_features = max number of features considered for splitting a node

max_depth = max number of levels in each decision tree

min_samples_split = min number of data points placed in a node before the node is split

min_samples_leaf = min number of data points allowed in a leaf node

bootstrap = method for sampling data points (with or without replacement)
