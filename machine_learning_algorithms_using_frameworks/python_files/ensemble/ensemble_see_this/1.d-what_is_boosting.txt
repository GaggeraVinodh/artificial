Boosting follows the following steps:

Creates a subset from the original dataset (Initially, all datapoints are weighted equally)

Creates and trains a base-model on the subset

The base model is used to make predictions on the whole dataset errors of the predictions are calculated

Incorrectly predicted datapoints (datapoints with bigger error) are given higher weights

Another model is created on the datapoints with high weights

Steps are repeated as long as needed

The final model is the weighted average of all models 
(better models get higher weights)
