ensemble learning

pshchological phenomenon called "wisdom of the crowd"


ensemble examples
-----------------
audience poll in who wants to be a millionaire - un-weighted average or majority vote

committee opinion - un-weighted average or majority vote

weighted average or majority vote



combining different predictors
this may be same kind of learner or different kinds of
learners

they can combine neural networks learners, decision trees and support vector machines (SVM)

predictor of predictors - using the outputs of the 
first set of predictors as features for the second set of predictors - somewhat like multilayer perceptrons




M features
m = Sq(M) = number of features used to build each tree

m = Sq(M/2)

25 features = M = 0 to 24 INPUT vectors or input variables or features

choose Sq(M) features to be used for each tree
m = 5
in 0 to 24 which number to take?
randomly any 5 by rnning a random number generator function
with range 0 t0 24 
rational reasoing
empirical reasoning

splitting criteria information gain,
