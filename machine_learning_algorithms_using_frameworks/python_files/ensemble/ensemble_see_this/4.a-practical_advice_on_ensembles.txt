some practical advice on ensembles

If the classifier is unstable (high variance), then apply bagging!

If the classifier is stable and simple (high bias) then apply boosting!

If the classifier is stable and complex then apply randomization injection!

If you have many classes and a binary classifier then try error-correcting codes! If it does not work then use a complex binary classifier!
