what are the benefits of association rule mining?

Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other

Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items 

Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y

X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X

ARM is very similar to item-item collaborative filtering

In ARM you dont have user profiles
you one have what people have actually bought
market basket analysis
e-commerce - what is the equ - cart - shopping cart
