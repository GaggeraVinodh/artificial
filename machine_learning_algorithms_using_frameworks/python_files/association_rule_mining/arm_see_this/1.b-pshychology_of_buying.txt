Milk is the most purchased item so it is always in the back of the store, making you walk by everything thing else they have before you get there, 

the fact that womenâ€™s shoes are always on the way to mens clothes, and 

the fact that bananas are at the front of stores because they are found to be an impulse buy

The one that seems to get the most requests though is the one that men who buy children's diapers for their kids are most likely to have beer also in their carts
