Algorithms in ecommerce are used in several ways:
-------------------------------------------------

Segmentation, learning from user behaviour and on-site data

Predicting customer preferences. Recommendation engines, which seek to show relevant products at the right time are one example of this

Predicting customer intent 

Using data such as previous browsing and add to cart behavior, algorithms can predict customer intent, when using site search for example



other benefits are

onsite search
pricing
inventory forecasting 
chatbots
helping and optimizing the subject of an email
personalization
segmentation
Common segmentation methods include:

Customer demographics – data such as age, gender, income and occupation can be used to target different customer groups in different ways

Customer lifetime value. It’s a good tactic to target the most valuable and most growable segments amongst your customers

Customer behavior – previous purchase history, browsing behavior on site etc

Devices and channels used. Customers can be grouped according to the devices they use to access your site, or the preferred channels

AI powered algorithms have the potential to analyse the various data sources, making connections that traditional segmentation methods may miss

image recognition ML algorithms can help
